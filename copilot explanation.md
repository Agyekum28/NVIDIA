This code defines a Streamlit web application that acts as a financial assistant focused on NVIDIA, leveraging both Tavily Search and Groq LLM (Language Learning Model) for data gathering and report generation. The application starts by importing necessary libraries for language models, caching, PDF processing, environment variable management, and the Streamlit UI framework. It sets up caching for LLM responses using both SQLite and in-memory caches, which helps improve performance by avoiding redundant computations.

The environment variables are loaded from a .env file, which is a common practice for managing sensitive information like API keys. The language model (`llm`) is initialized with the "llama-3.3-70b-versatile" model, and a search tool is set up to focus on the topic "Nvidia Stock," limiting results to two per query. An example query is run and printed to verify the search tool's functionality.

The core logic is encapsulated in the `generate_insights` function. This function takes a company URL, a list of competitors, and extracted PDF text as input. It performs a web search using the Tavily search tool, then constructs a prompt for the LLM that includes the PDF content, search results, and additional context. The prompt instructs the LLM to generate a one-page report with sections on company strategy, competitors or partnerships, leadership, and a forecast for NVIDIA stock, formatted with bullet points.

The Streamlit UI allows users to upload a PDF (such as a financial report), enter company details, and trigger report generation. Uploaded PDFs are saved temporarily and processed to extract text, which is stored in the session state for later use. When the user clicks "Generate Report," the app gathers all inputs, calls `generate_insights`, and displays the resulting analysis. If required fields are missing, a warning is shown. This setup enables users to easily combine document analysis, web search, and LLM-powered insights in a single, interactive workflow.
